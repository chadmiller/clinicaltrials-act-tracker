          <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/make-journals-report-clinical-trials-properly-1.19280">ongoing global public health problem</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The best currently available evidence shows that the results
          of clinical trials are routinely withheld from doctors,
          researchers, and patients. This is
          a <a href="http://alltrials.net/">global public health
          scandal</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>How do we contact you?</h2>

        <p>Email
        us! <a href="mailto:hello@ebmdatalab.net">hello@ebmdatalab.net</a>. We're
        always keen to hear feedback, user stories, insights you’ve
        made, errors, omissions, and feature requests.</p>

        <h2>What’s this all about?</h2>

        <p>The FDA Amendment Act 2007 (“FDAAA”) is a law which says that certain clinical trials have to report their results, within 12 months of completion. This is really important. Doctors and patients use the results of clinical trials to make informed choices about which medicine works best. But the best currently available evidence shows that trial results are routinely withheld. Previously, laws and guidelines aiming to fix this issue have been widely ignored, despite energetic <a href="http://www.alltrials.net/">campaigns</a>. So we built this website, to increase public accountability, and to help researchers make sure they report all their trials. You can read more about the problem in general, and this website, in our <a href="/static/fdaaa_trialstracker_2018.pdf">paper</a> on the project.</p>

        <h2>Who made the FDAAA TrialsTracker?</h2>
        <p>We are the <a href="https://ebmdatalab.net/">Evidence Based Medicine DataLab</a> at the University of Oxford, a team of academics, software engineers, and clinicians working together to make live interactive tools as well as academic papers. <a href="https://ebmdatalab.net/seb-bacon/">Seb Bacon</a> was the software engineer; <a href="https://ebmdatalab.net/nicholas-devito/">Nick DeVito</a> the researcher; <a href="https://ebmdatalab.net/ben-goldacre/">Ben Goldacre</a>  devised the project and was PI; <a href="http://bentheillustrator.com/">Ben O’Brien</a> was the illustrator; <a href="https://ebmdatalab.net/#team">everyone in the DataLab team</a> contributed. You can read more about our all work - on research integrity, and health informatics more broadly - at <a href="https://ebmdatalab.net/">ebmdatalab.net</a></p>

        <h2>I’m a nerd! How is this website built, and what assumptions do you make about the data?</h2>

        <p><a href="/static/fdaaa_trialstracker_2018.pdf">Our paper</a>
          is the best place to read the full
        technical details of how this site was made, how the data is
        processed, how the law operates, and how we translate that
          into code.</p>

        <p>There is <a href="/api/">an API</a>. It's somewhat
        self-explanatory; however, if you would like to use it and

        <h2>What can I do to help make sure sponsors share their results?</h2>
        <p>Trial reporting is a huge, global, ongoing problem. But
        there are more people working towards a solution than ever
        before.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <a href="http://alltrials.net">AllTrials.net</a>
          campaign calls for all trials to be reported, and now has
          the support of over 700 professional bodies, patient groups,
          government organisations, industry bodies, research funders,
          and more. Join them, support their work, and encourage your
          organisations to sign up to their simple pledge.</li>

          <li>You can advocate for better trial reporting in your own work community.</li>
          <li>You can use our data to encourage trialists to report their trials.</li>
          <li>You can call your elected representatives and tell them to pressure the FDA to levy fines and publicly censure researchers and sponsors who fail to report their trial results.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>I think some trials on clinicaltrials.gov are missing from
          your site! Doesn’t the law cover all trials?</h2>
        <p>Sadly, FDAAA 2007 only covers a narrow subgroup of
        trials. We think all trials should report results: you can
        read more about the AllTrials.net campaign online. On this
        website we track only compliance with the law. We have a range
        of “TrialsTrackers” which monitor reporting for other kinds of
        clinical trial
        at <a href="https://trialsTracker.net">TrialsTracker.net</a></p>


        <h2>What is the difference between an ACT and a pACT?</h2>

        <p>ACT stands for “Applicable Clinical Trial”. These are the
        specific trials required to report results under FDAAA. ACT,
        in the context of this tracker, is specifically referring to
        trials that began after the effective date of the 2016 “Final
        Rule” (January 18, 2017). While the Final Rule created much
        clearer criteria for identifying an ACT, trials that began
        before, and end after, the effective date may be required to
        report, but data on the criteria for judging whether they are
        is less available. These trials are called “probable ACTs”, or
        “pACTS” (by everybody, not just us!) and are identified by a
        different methodology. We have added a tag to every trial so
        you know which methodology was used to identify that
        trial. You can read the details on ACTs and pACTs in our
        paper.</p>


        <h2>I found a trial I think is due to report results, under FDAAA, but it’s not listed as due?</h2>
        <p>There are a number of reasons why a trial that completed 12 months ago may not yet be due to report results under FDAAA.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>The trial may have become due within the last month:</strong>
            After the trial becomes due, even when the results are submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov, there is a 30 day administrative window to post results. If a trial has submitted results, even if they haven’t been fully posted yet, this should be noted in the study record, and our “webscraping” tool will automatically find that information. However, to be safe, and to account for any updating delays by ClinicalTrials.gov, we wait this entire 30 day period before calling a trial “overdue”. If results show up in the meantime, we will show them as reported. You can read more detail on this in <a href="/static/fdaaa_trialstracker_2018.pdf">our paper</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The sponsor may have applied for an exemption:</strong>
            Sponsors can apply for a certificates that can delay the posting of results for certain trials, for up to 2 additional years. You can see if this is the case by clicking on the “Results’ tab on ClinicalTrials.gov. We might start flagging this on our website too, if it’s useful and interesting for you.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The trial may not be required to report results under FDAAA:</strong>
            Unfortunately, only a subset of all trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov are required to report results: essentially the law covers trials on drugs and devices: so a trial on a surgical technique, a public health intervention to reduce smoking, or a talking treatment for mental health problems, would likely be exempt. The trials covered by FDAAA are known as “Applicable Clinical Trials” or ACTs. Unhelpfully, although ClinicalTrials.gov know which trials are ACTs, they do not make this information public. We are, however, able to infer whether a trial is an ACT by using other publicly available data. You can read in detail about how we do this, in <a href="/static/fdaaa_trialstracker_2018.pdf">our paper</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>We may not have updated our data yet:</strong>
              If your trial became due very recently, you may need to wait for a data refresh. We’re planning to refresh the data on this site daily, at first, <a href="/fund/">resources permitting</a>. You can check in the footer of the website to see when we last updated our data, and when the next update is planned.</p>

            <p>If after reading this you think we are missing a due trial, please <a href="mailto:hello@ebmdatalab.net">get in touch</a>!</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How do you calculate what fines a sponsor could receive?</h2>
        <p>The FDA can fine non-reporting sponsors up to $10,000 a day following a 30 day notice period. We calculate the maximum possible fine assuming the sponsor was notified the day after they failed to meet their submission deadline. So each day after 395 days since trial completion without submitted results is another $10,000. You can read more on this in <a href="/static/fdaaa_trialstracker_2018.pdf">our paper</a>.</p>
        <h2>When was the data last updated?</h2>
        <p>
          The current data was taken from ClinicalTrials.gov on {{ LATEST_DATE|date:"j F Y" }}. Our next update of the data is planned for {{ NEXT_PLANNED_UPDATE|date:"j F Y" }}.
