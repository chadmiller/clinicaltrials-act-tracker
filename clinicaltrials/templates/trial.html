      <strong>Think we've made a mistake?</strong>  Before <a href="mailto:hello@ebmdatalab.net">contacting us</a>, review the criteria in <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/02/20/266452.full.pdf">our paper</a>. In particular, bear in mind the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Reporting in a journal is not enough. The rules state that the trial must be reported on ClinicalTrials.gov</li>
        <li>Terminated trials are required to report results. Only withdrawn trials (which never recruited a single patient) are not
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

  {% elif trial.status == 'reported' %}

    <p>
     This trial has reported on time, in line with the regulations.
    </p>

  {% elif trial.status == 'reported-late' %}

    <p>
     This trial has reported, although it was <strong>{{ trials.days_late }} days late</strong> in doing so.
