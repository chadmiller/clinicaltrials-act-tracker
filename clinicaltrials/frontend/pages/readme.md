## This is a sample static page

Format the page using markdown.

A page placed in the repo at `pages/thing.md` will be made available at the URL https://fdaaa.trialstracker.net/page/thing.

Pages in the repo at `pages/trials/` are treated specially: if the page name matches a trial registry id, then anything "above the fold" will appear on the corresponding trial page, with a link to the full page.

A fold is a horizontal rule, which you do in markdown like this:

----

This is now "below the fold".
